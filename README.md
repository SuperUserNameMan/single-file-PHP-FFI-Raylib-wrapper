# single-file-PHP-FFI-Raylib-wrapper
A single file [PHP8](https://github.com/php/php-src) FFI [Raylib 4.5](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) wrapper.

Very W.I.P.

Only need `libraylib.so` or `raylib.dll` into a `.\raylib\`, or `.\lib` or `.\` sub directory.

All RLAPI function and enums and consts are prefixed with `RL_`.
